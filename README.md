<h1>Elementary Blog</h1>
<p>
Elementary blog is a lightweight static blogging platform designed to be complex and open enough for expandability by engineers and
simple enough to be highly tweakable by non-coders.
<br><br>
The platform will evolve over time but the initial goal is to make a barebones system that can be somewhat easily used by any end
user. The platform features simple-ish blog posting, simple theme files and simple expandability via generic Javascript based plugins.
Or at least it will.
